        <p>
          Let's be honest, chicken teriyaki is just good. I loved it so much as
          a kid that I could practically just drink the sauce out of the bottle.
          What's even better is that I still love it as an adult! It's super
          easy to make, everyone loves it, and it creates well balanced and
          versatile meals. I recently figured out how to make traditional
          teriyaki sauce and it's actually super easy to make. So in today's
          episode, we are going to dive deep into the world of teriyaki so that
          one of my favorite childhood dishes can be adding to your arsenal of
          favorite go to meals!

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by peeling your ginger and garlic. Chop the aromatics into very
          fine pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, drizzle in 1 tbsps of oil and drop in your finely chopped
          garlic and ginger. On low heat, let the garlic and ginger bloom and
          become fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          After about 3 minutes, add in equal parts of sake, mirin, and soy
          sauce. Bring to a boil and let the alcohol cook off. This will take
          about 5 minutes on medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the sauce has reduced by about 1/3, mix together the corn starch
          and water in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle in your corn starch slurry and give it a mix. Your teriyaki
          sauce should become nice and thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally add in about 1 tbsps of sesame seeds. Stir to combine and
          once the sauce is cooled store in an air tight jar. Keep in the fridge
          until you are ready to use!

        <p>
          Beef Wellington is a traditional British dish that is said to have
          originated in the 1800s after the Duke of Wellington won a victory in
          Waterloo. The celebratory dish became a classic that rose to
          popularity as a fancy dish at dinner parties and holidays in the mid
          1900's. Traditionally, the dish centers around beef surrounded by
          pâté, mushrooms and some form of ham that is then wrapped in puff
          pastry and baked in the oven.

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously
          with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once
          pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all
          sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes
          total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off
          twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms,
          shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.
        </li>
        <li>
          To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture
          and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with
          salt and pepper, then let cool in fridge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s
          twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the prosciutto
          on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the
          whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the
          prosciutto.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll
          meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll
          tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of
          plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this
          helps it maintain its shape).
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out
          puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the
          tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you
          just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom
          of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg
          wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry,
          then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap
          to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet.
          Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for
          medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before
          carving and serving.

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil</li>
        <li>
          Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely
          grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little
          freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the
          water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for
          10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
        </li>
        <li>
          Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to
          bruise it.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop
          50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the
          butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often,
          until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted
          its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift
          it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying
          pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan
          as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away
          yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back
          for sprinkling over later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour
          in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the
          spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but
          doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tbspss
          should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little
          salt, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or
          bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining
          cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little
          dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy
          sauciness will be revived.
