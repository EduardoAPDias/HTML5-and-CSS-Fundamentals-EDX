      <p>
        Let's be honest, chicken teriyaki is just good. I loved it so much as a
        kid that I could practically just drink the sauce out of the bottle.
        What's even better is that I still love it as an adult! It's super easy
        to make, everyone loves it, and it creates well balanced and versatile
        meals. I recently figured out how to make traditional teriyaki sauce and
        it's actually super easy to make. So in today's episode, we are going to
        dive deep into the world of teriyaki so that one of my favorite
        childhood dishes can be adding to your arsenal of favorite go to meals!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 knob of ginger</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
      <li>1 cup of sake</li>
      <li>1 cup of mirin</li>
      <li>1 cup of soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>4 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by peeling your ginger and garlic. Chop the aromatics into very
        fine pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, drizzle in 1 tablespoon of oil and drop in your finely chopped
        garlic and ginger. On low heat, let the garlic and ginger bloom and
        become fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        After about 3 minutes, add in equal parts of sake, mirin, and soy sauce.
        Bring to a boil and let the alcohol cook off. This will take about 5
        minutes on medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the sauce has reduced by about 1/3, mix together the corn starch
        and water in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle in your corn starch slurry and give it a mix. Your teriyaki
        sauce should become nice and thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally add in about 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds. Stir to combine and
        once the sauce is cooled store in an air tight jar. Keep in the fridge
        until you are ready to use!
